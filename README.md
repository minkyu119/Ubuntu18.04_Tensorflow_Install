# Ubuntu18.04_Tensorflow_Install

Requirements
An NVIDIA GPU with a compute capability of 3.0 or higher.
I'll be using a GTX 1050 Ti hooked up externally to a thinkpad T420s through the express card port
Python installed.
Ubuntu comes with python already installed but I will be using anaconda
Overview
Step 1: Update your GPU driver (should be higher than version 390)
Step 2: Install the CUDA Toolkit version 9.0 (with all the patches)
Step 3: Install CUDNN 7.0.5
Step 4: Install Tensorflow GPU with pip
Step 5: Test it!
Step 1: Update your GPU driver
Open a terminal and run the following 3 commands

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-390
Reboot your computer. To verify the installation, open a terminal and run the following command

nvidia-smi
The output should show the GPU name and the driver

Step 2: Install the CUDA Toolkit (9.0)
go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive and download the toolkit for linux, x86_64, ubuntu, 17.04, deb l
once the download is complete, open a terminal in the directory the base installer is and run the follow commands
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1704-9-0-local_9.0.176-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-key add /var/cuda-repo-9-0-local/7fa2af80.pub
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda
download patch 1 and install (you should get a prompt to install once its done downloading)
download patch 2 and install (you should get a prompt to install once its done downloading)
open your .bashrc file with nano
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
go to the last line and add the following lines (this will set your PATH variable)
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/bin${PATH:+:$PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
Step 3: Install CUDNN 7.0.5
go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
Select CUDNN 7.0.5 for CUDA 9.0
download the cuDNN v7.0.5 Library for Linux (tar file)
open a terminal in the directory the tar file is located
unzip the tar file using the command
tar -xzvf cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.tgz
run the following commands to move the appropriate files to the CUDA folder
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*
Step 4: pip install tensorflow-gpu
I will be using a conda environment for installing tensorflow

create a conda environment by using the following command
conda create -n tf python=3.6 pip
activate your environment using
source activate tf
run the following command to install tensorflow

pip install tensorflow-gpu==15
Step 5: Test it!
start a python interpreter in the terminal by typing
python
run the following lines
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('hello tensorflow')
>>> with tf.Session() as sesh:
>>>     sesh.run(hello)
the output should be
>>> 'hello tensorflow'
